This repository is the official implementation of paper "Diffusion-based Generation, Optimization, and Planning in 3D Scenes".

We introduce SceneDiffuser, a conditional generative model for 3D scene understanding. SceneDiffuser provides a unified model for solving scene-conditioned generation, optimization, and planning. In contrast to prior work, SceneDiffuser is intrinsically scene-aware, physics-based, and goal-oriented.

## Abstract

We introduce SceneDiffuser, a conditional generative model for 3D scene understanding. SceneDiffuser provides a unified model for solving scene-conditioned generation, optimization, and planning. In contrast to prior works, SceneDiffuser is intrinsically scene-aware, physics-based, and goal-oriented. With an iterative sampling strategy, SceneDiffuser jointly formulates the scene-aware generation, physics-based optimization, and goal-oriented planning via a diffusion-based denoising process in a fully differentiable fashion. Such a design alleviates the discrepancies among different modules and the posterior collapse of previous scene-conditioned generative models. We evaluate SceneDiffuser with various 3D scene understanding tasks, including human pose and motion generation, dexterous grasp generation, path planning for 3D navigation, and motion planning for robot arms. The results show significant improvements compared with previous models, demonstrating the tremendous potential of SceneDiffuser for the broad community of 3D scene understanding.

## News

- [ 2023.04 ] We release the code for grasp generation and arm motion planning!

## Setup

1. Create a new `conda` environemnt and activate it.

    ```bash
    conda create -n 3d python=3.8
    conda activate 3d
    ```

2. Install dependent libraries with `pip`.
    (comment pytorch3d if problem)
    ```bash
    pip install -r pre-requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    <!-- - We use `pytorch1.11` and `cuda11.3`, modify `pre-requirements.txt` to install [other versions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) of `pytorch`. -->
    install pytorch3d from their official [website](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

    ```
    pip install fvcore
    pip install --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py38_cu113_pyt1110/download.html
    ```

3. Install [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and install [pointnet2](https://github.com/daveredrum/Pointnet2.ScanNet) by executing the following command (optional for grasp generation and arm motion planning).

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/daveredrum/Pointnet2.ScanNet.git#subdirectory=pointnet2
    ```

## Data & Checkpoints

### 1. Data

You can use our [pre-processed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CKJER3CnVh0o8cwlN8a2c0kQ6HTEqvqj?usp=sharing) or process the data by yourself following the [instructions](./preprocessing/README.md).

But, you also need to download some official released data assets which are not processed, see [instructions](./preprocessing/README.md). Please remember to use your own data path by modifying the path configuration in:

- `scene_model.pretrained_weights` in `model/*.yaml` for the path of pre-trained scene encoder (if you use a pre-trained scene encoder)

- `dataset.*_dir`/`dataset.*_path` configurations in `task/*.yaml` for the path of data assets

### 2. Checkpoints

Download our [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CKJER3CnVh0o8cwlN8a2c0kQ6HTEqvqj?usp=sharing) and unzip them into a folder, e.g., `./outputs/`.

    ```bash
    bash scripts/pose_gen/train_ddm.sh ${EXP_NAME}
    ```

### Test (Quantitative Evaluation)

```bash
bash scripts/pose_gen/test.sh ${CKPT} [OPT]
